# 📌 Submission Reminder App

A Bash-based reminder system for checking student submissions.

---

## 📝 Overview

This Bash project reminds students about assignments they haven’t submitted.  
It automatically creates the required folders and files, ensures scripts are executable, and allows easy updates to the assignment name (using a copilot helper script).

This version is portable and intended to run on Linux, macOS (Git Bash), or Windows (Git Bash / WSL).

## ⚙️ Scripts in This Project

### 1. `create_environment.sh`
- Prompts for your name.
- Creates a folder called `submission_reminder_<yourName>` (sanitized, lowercase).
- Sets up all needed subfolders and files (`app`, `modules`, `assets`, `config`).
- Populates `config/config.env`, `modules/functions.sh`, `app/reminder.sh`, `assets/submissions.txt` (includes 5+ extra test students).
- Creates a robust `startup.sh` inside the generated folder.
- Makes all `.sh` files executable (best-effort).

**Run (from repo root):**
```bash
./create_environment.sh
```

### 2. `copilot_shell_script.sh`
- Lives in the repo root (same level as `create_environment.sh`).
- Finds any `submission_reminder_*` folders in the repo root and lets you choose which one to update.
- Prompts for a new assignment name and updates `ASSIGNMENT` in that app's `config/config.env` (portable sed/fallback approach).
- Optionally runs the chosen app's `startup.sh` after updating.

**Run (from repo root):**
```bash
./copilot_shell_script.sh
```

### 3. `startup.sh`
- Placed inside `submission_reminder_<yourName>/startup.sh` (generated by `create_environment.sh`).
- Validates required files, sets execute permissions (best-effort), sources `config/config.env`, and runs `app/reminder.sh`.
- This file contains the robust startup logic included with the project so the app runs reliably.

**Run (inside the created app folder):**
```bash
cd submission_reminder_<yourName>
./startup.sh
```

## 🗂 Directory Structure

After running the setup script:

```
submission_reminder_<yourName>/
├── startup.sh
├── app/
│   └── reminder.sh
├── config/
│   └── config.env
├── modules/
│   └── functions.sh
└── assets/
    └── submissions.txt
```

Files required in main repo root:

```
create_environment.sh
copilot_shell_script.sh
README.md
```

---

## 🌿 Git Workflow (short)

Recommended workflow used for submission:

### Work on a feature branch for full app/testing:
```bash
git checkout -b feature/setup
# add create_environment.sh, copilot_shell_script.sh, README.md
# run ./create_environment.sh and test the generated app locally
git add .
git commit -m "Feature: add environment builder and test app"
git push -u origin feature/setup
```

### Keep main clean (only required files). From main, bring just the three files into main:
```bash
git checkout main
git checkout feature/setup -- create_environment.sh copilot_shell_script.sh README.md
git add create_environment.sh copilot_shell_script.sh README.md
git commit -m "Prepare main: add create_environment, copilot script and README"
git push origin main
```

Optionally create a Pull Request from `feature/setup → main` for record; avoid merging the entire app folder into main unless instructed.

## 🧠 Learning Goals

- Learn Bash scripting and automation  
- Understand file and folder organization  
- Practice Git branching and merging (feature & main)  
- Manage configurations with environment files

## ✅ How to Run

### Step 1: Clone the repository
```bash
git clone https://github.com/ehabimfura/submission_reminder_app_ehabimfura.git
cd submission_reminder_app_ehabimfura
```

### Step 2: Create a feature branch and add scripts (if starting fresh)
```bash
git checkout -b feature/setup
# create or paste create_environment.sh and copilot_shell_script.sh in repo root
chmod +x create_environment.sh copilot_shell_script.sh
git add create_environment.sh copilot_shell_script.sh README.md
git commit -m "Add setup and copilot scripts"
git push -u origin feature/setup
```

### Step 3: Setup environment (on feature branch)
```bash
./create_environment.sh
# enter your name when prompted -> creates submission_reminder_<yourName>/
```

### Step 4: Start reminder app
```bash
cd submission_reminder_<yourName>
./startup.sh
```

### Step 5: Update assignment (from repo root)
```bash
cd ..
./copilot_shell_script.sh
```

The copilot script will locate the app directory, update `config/config.env`, and optionally run `startup.sh`.

## 🧪 Example Output

```
Assignment: Shell Navigation
Days remaining to submit: 2 days
--------------------------------------------
Reminder: Divine has not submitted the Shell Navigation assignment!
Reminder: Chinemerem has not submitted the Shell Navigation assignment!
```

## 💡 Notes & Troubleshooting

- The scripts are written for Bash. On Windows, run them in Git Bash or WSL.
- If you get an error like bad interpreter or `^M` characters, convert line endings (`dos2unix`) or ensure your editor saves LF line endings.
- `create_environment.sh` sanitizes the name you enter (lowercase, alphanumeric + underscores).
- `copilot_shell_script.sh` should be in the repo root so graders find it easily; it will locate the app folder automatically.
- Keep the full working app (the generated `submission_reminder_<yourName>` folder) on a feature branch for testing.  
  The main branch should contain only the three required files for submission.

🎉 Have fun!
